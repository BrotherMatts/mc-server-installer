MC-SERVER-INSTALLER is not an officially supported or licensed application of Mojang.

The first time you run the installer, you'll need to download the .jar file (i.e. select option #1) and attempt
to start the server (e.g. select option #3). Once selected, the server will attempt to run and fail, stating that
you need to agree to the EULA.

## NO. THIS WON'T BE CHANGED! 
##   BECAUSE LEGAL STUFF
 
 You may then select option #2 and proceed with choosing any of the other options or setting up your server's 
 configuration, which is located in:
 ```
 ~/snap/mc-server-installer/current"
